# Oldify
Welcome to Oldify, a community-driven project to bring back Spotify for older versions of macOS, such as macOS 10.10.

Spotify has officially discontinued support for older versions of macOS, but we believe that everyone should have access to the best music in the world. That's why we're working to create a version of Spotify that will work on older macOS versions.

We're still in the early stages of development, but we've made a lot of progress so far. We have a working version of Spotify that runs on macOS 10.10, and we're working on adding support for other older/unsupported versions of macOS.
Please tell people about our project if you can, as that would really help.
Thank you for your support!

The project is open source, so anyone can contribute.
There are a number of ways to help, even if you're not a developer. You can test the software, report bugs, and provide feedback.
The project is still in the early stages, but it is making good progress.
The goal is to eventually make Oldify available for all versions of macOS that Spotify had officially supported.
